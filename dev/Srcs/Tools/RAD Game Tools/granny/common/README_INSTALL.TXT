Note on installing the Granny SDK
---------------------------------

If you're installing the Granny SDK for the first time, here's how you
go about it!  You will have been given FTP access to a set of
directories corresponding to the platforms you're using.  Download all
of the files you find in those directories, and unzip them on top of
each other.  You're done!

Once you've unzipped the sdk, there are a few directories that you'll
want to look at right away.  "Doc" and "Tutorials" are the obvious
places to start.  If you're evaluating Granny, you won't have the
source code, but you'll find the Granny headers in "Include", and the
libraries in "lib/<platform>".  If you've licensed Granny, you'll find
the source code in (oddly enough) "Source", while the project files
for building your own version of the Granny libraries will be in
"Projects".

Please let us know if you have any questions or problems, we're always
available at granny3@radgametools.com. Thanks for using Granny!
