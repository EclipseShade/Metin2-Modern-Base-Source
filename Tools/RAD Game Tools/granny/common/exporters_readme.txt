The Granny exporters come in two flavors:

The .exe is a self-extracting archive that will search for the
art tools installed on your machine, and automatically install
the appropriate Granny plug-ins in their appropriate locations.
If you want a hands-free, simple installation, download and run
this.

granny_common*.zip contains all the plug-ins zipped up in
the "exporters" root directory. If for some reason the .exe
doesn't work, or if you'd prefer to do the installation manually,
then download this and unpack the plug-in file you want into the
plug-ins directory of the art tool you're using.

If you have any questions, please consult the Granny SDK
documentation for more details.
